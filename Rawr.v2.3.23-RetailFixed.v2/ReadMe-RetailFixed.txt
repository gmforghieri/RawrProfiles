Notes on this Edition:
- Edited character and pets talent sheets with optimizations.
- Now it shows all the icons correctly. Thanks to suicidalkatt for his icon pack (Clean Icons - Crisp).
- Added Earthen Leg Armor enchant.

Rawr Known Bugs:
- Hunter's module doesn't work at all unless you choose a ranged weapon first.
- When you select the talent "Veteran of the Third War" (Blood DK) the application forces close, that's why I added a Blood.xml sheet with the talent enabled, it works this way.
- If you try to select a relic or trinket in Elemental Shaman's module, Rawr crashes. That's why I added a Elemental.xml for you to edit. To change them, you have to force them by editing the .XML file directly.
